# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer-in-Python
The human brain can easily process visuals instead of long codes to understand the algorithms.

In this project I have designed and developed a program that visualizes 6 different Sorting Algorithms with a neat GUI and smooth Animations.

The program has been implemented using Python, Tkinterand alot of debugging/google searches.

**How To use -**
1. open Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer.exe.
2. click generate to create a random array.
3. Choose your desired algorithms from dropdown menu.
4. click sort.
5. click stop to interrupt sorting  algorithm.
6. click exit to stop program.

**Technology Used -**
1. Python
2. Tkinter
3. Pyinstaller
