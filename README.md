# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer-in-Python
The human mind is more efficient to process visuals stimulus instead of complex codes to understand the algorithms
So, have designed and developed a program that visualizes 7 different Sorting Algorithms with a neat GUI and smooth Animations.

**How To use -**
1. Open Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer.exe.
2. Click **Generate** to create a random array.
3. Choose your desired algorithms from dropdown menu.
4. Click **Sort** start algorithm.
5. Click **Stop** to pause sorting algorithm.
6. Click **Exit** to stop program.

**Technology Used -**
1. Python
2. Tkinter
3. Pyinstaller
